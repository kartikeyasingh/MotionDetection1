============================

This directory contains 2 Java files:
  * OpticalFlowMove.java, Direction.java

There are 2 batch files:
  * compile.bat
  * run.bat
     - make sure they refer to the correct locations for your
       downloads of JavaCV and OpenCV


----------------------------
Before Compilation/Execution:

You need to have a webcam connected to your PC.

You need to download and install:

  * OpenCV:  I downloaded v2.4.5 for Windows with pre-compiled binaries:
             from http://opencv.org/downloads.html
             and installed it in C:\opencv

  * JavaCV:  http://code.google.com/p/javacv/
             I downloaded javacv-0.5-bin.zip
             and installed it in d:\javacv-bin


----------------------------
Compilation:

> compile *.java
    // you must have JavaCV and OpenCV installed

----------------------------
Execution:
    // you must have JavaCV and OpenCV installed

> run OpticalFlowMove
      -- click on either of the 2 window's close box to make the application exit
